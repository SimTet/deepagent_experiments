# EPIC-002: ML-Powered Real-time Fraud Detection System

**Priority:** High
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2026-01-11
**Estimated Effort:** XL

## Description

Develop and implement a machine learning-powered system to detect and prevent various types of financial fraud in real-time. This system will leverage advanced ML models to analyze transaction data, identify suspicious patterns, and flag potential fraudulent activities, thereby reducing financial losses and improving operational efficiency.

## Business Value

This system will significantly reduce financial losses due to fraud, decrease the operational costs associated with manual fraud investigations, and enhance customer trust by providing a more secure transaction environment. It will also enable faster adaptation to evolving fraud tactics.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The ML system can detect credit card fraud with a precision of at least 90% and recall of at least 85%.
2. The ML system can detect account takeover fraud with a precision of at least 88% and recall of at least 82%.
3. The system processes transactions with an end-to-end latency of under 500ms for fraud detection.
4. The system integrates with existing transaction processing systems for real-time data ingestion and decisioning.
5. The system provides an explainability mechanism for flagged transactions to assist fraud analysts.
6. The system is scalable to handle a minimum of 10 million transactions per day.
7. A mechanism for continuous model retraining and performance monitoring is in place.
8. The system adheres to all relevant data privacy and compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
